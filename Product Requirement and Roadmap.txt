# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. **Overview**

Build a web app where users can input a Magic: The Gathering deck list and easily search each card on multiple Canadian game store websites (401 Games, The CG Realm, Imaginaire) by opening search result tabs.

---

## 2. **Core Features**

### ✅ Deck Input

- Users can paste a plain-text deck list (1 card per line).  

### ✅ Card Parsing

### ✅ Card Display

- Display each card in a clean list.
    
- Include card images (via Scryfall API).
    

### ✅ Store Search Links

- Each card has a button that opens **store search URLs** in new tabs:
    
    - [401 Games](https://store.401games.ca/)
        
    - [The CG Realm](https://www.thecgrealm.com/)
        
    - [Imaginaire](https://imaginaire.com/)
    - https://hobbiesville.com/
