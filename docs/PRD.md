* PRD: MTG Player's Assistant
* Version: 3.0 (Comprehensive Hybrid Data Model)

### 1.2 Product Summary
The MTG Player's Assistant is a feature-rich web-based utility designed to empower Magic: The Gathering players with insightful deck analysis and powerful probability calculations. By leveraging local Scryfall bulk data for core card information and strategic Scryfall API calls for dynamic searching, the tool aims to provide critical information for deckbuilding decisions, game planning, and understanding deck consistency. This version expands on fundamental probability calculators with extensive deck statistics, advanced search capabilities, and user experience enhancements, all while prioritizing performance and reliability through a hybrid data fetching approach.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Core Functionality

#### **Local Scryfall Data Management** (Priority: Critical - Foundational)
* **Initial Download/Update Check:** Upon application startup or a user-initiated refresh, the system will check the Scryfall `/bulk-data` API endpoint for the `oracle_cards` bulk data file.
* **Timestamp Comparison:** It will compare the `updated_at` timestamp of the remote bulk data file with the timestamp of the locally stored `oracle_cards.json`.
* **Conditional Download:** If the remote file is newer, the application will download and decompress the new `oracle_cards.json` file, replacing the existing local copy. This ensures the application has up-to-date gameplay data.
* **In-Memory Indexing:** After download (or if the local file is already current), the application will load the `oracle_cards.json` into an efficient in-memory data structure (e.g., a hash map/dictionary keyed by card name and Scryfall ID) for rapid lookups.

#### **Moxfield Decklist Import** (Priority: High)
* Upon successful import, parse the decklist to extract card names and quantities.
* **LOCAL LOOKUP:** For each card name extracted, perform a lookup in the locally cached Scryfall `oracle_cards` data to retrieve comprehensive card data (CMC, colors, type line, oracle text, etc.).
* **API FALLBACK (for missing cards):** If a card name is not found in the local bulk data (e.g., a very recent spoiler not yet in the daily bulk export), a targeted Scryfall API call (`/cards/named?exact={card_name}`) will be made as a fallback. This retrieved data will be cached in-memory for the current session.
* Display the imported decklist in a clear, organized format (e.g., list of card names with quantities, alongside Scryfall-fetched images).

### 2.2 Probability Calculators

### 2.6 Combo Detection from Decklist (Priority: High)

    Description: Allows users to find known combos from the Commander Spellbook database that are present within their imported decklist.

    Inputs: The user's currently imported decklist (card names and quantities).

    Process:

        Extract Card Names: From the imported decklist, extract a unique list of all card names (ignoring quantities for the API call, as the API expects unique card names).

        API Request: Make a POST request to the Commander Spellbook API's /find-my-combos endpoint. The request body should contain a list of the card names from the deck.

            API Endpoint: https://backend.commanderspellbook.com/find-my-combos

            Method: POST

            Request Body Format (JSON):
            JSON

        {
            "cards": [
                "Sol Ring",
                "Sensei's Divining Top",
                "Future Sight",
                "Thassa's Oracle",
                "Demonic Consultation",
                "Dockside Extortionist",
                "Temur Sabertooth",
                "Cloud of Faeries"
                // ... and so on for all unique cards in the deck
            ]
        }

    Process API Response: Parse the JSON response from the Commander Spellbook API. The response will contain a list of Combo objects found within the submitted card list.

    Display Combos: Present the found combos to the user. For each combo, display:

        The name of the combo.

        The cards involved in the combo.

        A brief description of what the combo does (its "results").

        A link to the combo's page on Commander Spellbook (optional, but highly recommended for more details).

Output:

    A clear list of detected combos.

    For each combo, display the constituent cards and the combo's outcome/effect.

    Visually highlight cards in the combo that are present in the user's deck.

    If no combos are found, display an appropriate message.

## 3. Out of Scope

* **Price Data:** No functionality for fetching, displaying, or tracking card prices.
* **New Card Data (Instantaneous):** While the bulk data updates daily, immediate access to cards released *since the last bulk data update* is not guaranteed for core functionalities (API fallback mitigates this for imports/searches but not as a primary feature).
* **Specific Prints/Images:** The application will primarily use the representative image provided by the `oracle_cards` bulk data (usually the most recognizable or latest main set printing). Functionality to select or display alternative printings/artworks is out of scope.
* **Rulings Display:** No functionality to look up or display specific card rulings.
* **Wishlist/Collection Tracking (Persistent):** Allow users to "save" cards they are interested in to a local wishlist or mark cards they own in a simple collection tracker. This is explicitly *out of scope for this version* as it implies user-specific persistent data management beyond basic settings.
* **User Accounts/Authentication:** No user login or personalized data storage is planned. All data is session-based.
* **Deck Export Functionality:** Exporting modified decklists or analysis reports is not included.
* **Direct MTG Arena/MTGO Integration:** No direct API integration with game clients.
* **Print Proxy Generation:** Generating print-friendly proxies of cards is out of scope.

## 4. Technical Considerations

* **Scryfall Bulk Data Handling:** Implement robust mechanisms for:
    * Checking `updated_at` timestamps via the `/bulk-data` API endpoint.
    * Downloading and decompressing large gzipped JSON files.
    * Loading and indexing the `oracle_cards.json` into an efficient in-memory structure (e.g., a hash map for name-to-card and ID-to-card lookups).
    * Managing potential memory usage for the bulk data.
* **Scryfall API Usage (Targeted):**
    * Adhere to Scryfall's API rate limits (10 requests/sec, 75 requests burst) for the limited API calls (autocomplete, multi-criteria search, and rare fallbacks for missing cards). Implement appropriate delays or a robust queue.
    * Utilize the `/cards/autocomplete` endpoint for real-time search suggestions.
    * Utilize `/cards/search` for multi-criteria searching.
    * Utilize `/cards/named` for fallback lookup of cards not found in local bulk data.
* **Frontend Framework (if web-based):** Choose a suitable frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) for efficient UI rendering, component management, and state management.
* **Backend (if applicable):** If a backend is used, it should primarily handle the bulk data download and potentially serve card data to the frontend, abstracting the bulk data management from the client. Direct client-side download of bulk data might be considered for simplicity but requires careful handling of large files in the browser.
* **Mathematical Libraries:** Utilize reliable libraries for hypergeometric calculations (e.g., `math.comb` in Python, or a custom implementation for JavaScript combinations).
* **Charting Libraries:** Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js for JavaScript; Matplotlib, Seaborn for Python) for mana curve and color distribution visualizations.
* **Handling the API Response:**

    The response will be a JSON array of combo objects. Each object will likely contain fields like id, name, cards, prerequisites, steps, results, color_identity, etc.

    You'll primarily be interested in name, cards (a list of objects, each with a name for the card), and results
* ** Displaying the Combos:**

    Clarity: Make it easy for the user to see the detected combos. A dedicated section or tab in the UI would be appropriate.

    Card Matching: When displaying a combo, compare the cards array from the Commander Spellbook response against the cards actually present in the user's imported deck. You might want to visually indicate which of the combo's constituent cards are indeed in the deck (e.g., green checkmark, bolding).

    Links: Provide a link back to the combo's specific page on Commander Spellbook (e.g., https://commanderspellbook.com/combo/<combo_id>) for detailed steps, explanations, and variants. The combo ID will be in the API response.

## 5. Success Metrics

* **Performance:**
    * Deck analysis (after initial bulk data load) should complete within 1-2 seconds for typical deck sizes (e.g., 100 cards).
    * Single card lookups and multi-criteria searches (after initial bulk data load) should be near-instantaneous (sub-100ms for local lookups, responsive for API calls).
    * Initial bulk data download and indexing time should be reasonable (e.g., under 30 seconds on a good connection).
* **User Engagement:** High adoption rates for deck analysis features, probability calculators, and advanced search.
* **User Feedback:** Positive feedback regarding the speed, utility, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of the tools.
* **API Error Rate:** Minimal instances of Scryfall API rate limit errors for the targeted calls.
